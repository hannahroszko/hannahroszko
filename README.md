## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Political Science, History, and Economics student at Villanova University passionate about expanding data literacy by making open-source resources more acessible and, frankly, less intimidating. I view empirical methodology as central to finding common-sense solutions to severely politicized issues. I enjoy working in R and was recently named Honorable Mention and Finalist of the annual Philadelphia DataFest alongside two of my classmates.
